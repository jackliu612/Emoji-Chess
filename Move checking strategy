Move checking strategy
	Given move string, 5 possibilities
		1) full begin --> completed already
		2) only row --> find piece and get column
		3) only column --> find piece and get row
		4) none --> find piece based on which ones can move to end spot
		5) other --> simply wrong and stop

Checking valid moves
